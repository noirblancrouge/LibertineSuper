LibertineSuper comes in seven weights, and a variable version, including multilingual support and openType features.

LibertineSuper’s got these cool decorative lines in its default style, but if you’re more into easy reading, just hit up stylistic set 1 for a cleaner look. Fun fact: This font was born for the Libertine Supersport party’s vibe – so it knows how to party while looking sharp!
